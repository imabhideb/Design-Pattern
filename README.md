# Design Patterns in Java Repository

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various **Design Patterns** in Java. Each folder represents a different pattern with a structured implementation, including a README explaining its concept and usage.

## Patterns Implemented

### 1. **Factory Pattern & Abstract Factory Pattern**
- Demonstrates how to create objects without specifying the exact class.
- Implements both **Factory** and **Abstract Factory** to show the differences.
- Located in: `Factory Pattern & Abstract Factory Pattern/`

### 2. **Decorator Design Pattern**
- Shows how to dynamically extend object functionality without modifying the existing class.
- Uses a coffee example with decorators like **Milk** and **Sugar**.
- Located in: `Decorator Design Pattern/`

### 3. **Observer Design Pattern**
- Demonstrates a publisher-subscriber mechanism where objects are notified of changes.
- Helps in scenarios like event handling and data change notifications.
- Located in: `Observer Design Pattern/`

### 4. **Strategic Design Pattern**
- Implements a strategy pattern to allow behavior changes at runtime.
- Useful for implementing algorithms with interchangeable strategies.
- Located in: `Strategic Design Pattern/`
